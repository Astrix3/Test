# btreeMirror.js
 - Contains the code to mirror the binary tree.
 - To test simply run <b>node btreeMirror</b>
 
# For second question:

Create a simple node js app that 
1) has the api endpoint GET '/api/event' 
2) The response to the above api should be 
{
 "client_ip": "123.123.123.123",
 "visit_count": 123 
}

Where client ip is the ip of the client calling the api. And visit count is number of time the given ip called the api.
The visit_count should persist across server restarts.

- Simply run <b>npm ready and then npm start</b>
- http://localhost:3000/api/event hit the api.
